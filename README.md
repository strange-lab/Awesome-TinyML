 TinyML or Embedded system based Machine learning resources and notes

# Importance (Copied) 

- Running deep neural networks (DNNs) on tiny Micro-controller Units (MCUs) is challenging due to their limitations in computing, memory, and storage capacity 

# Raspberry Pi based

Cyber Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11212.pdf)

In this paper, we present DeepPicarMicro, a small self-driving
RC car testbed, which runs a convolutional neural network
(CNN) on a Raspberry Pi Pico MCU. We apply a state-of-the-
art DNN optimization to successfully fit the well-known PilotNet
CNN architecture, which was used to drive NVIDIAâ€™s real self-
driving car, on the MCU
